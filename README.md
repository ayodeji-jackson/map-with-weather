# map with weather
- There should be a sidebar with 20 random cities from all over the world (up to you, select any you want).
- There should be an input which will start filter cities by entered value (mini search). It should filter cities only from available list.
- When I click on a city name from the list, I should switch to it on a map. There should be displayed an information icon (you can use any from the internet or from any font icons).
- When I click an icon, I should see a mapbox popup with a weather forecast. Please, add a forecast for today and tomorrow (design is up to you)
